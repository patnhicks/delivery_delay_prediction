## Late Delivery Prediction 

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting delivery delays using large-scale, real-world trasnportation data taken from 
the US Dept of Transportation (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  

The goal of the Delay Delivery Prediction project is a decision-support model that identifies operations drivers 
of delay and supports proactive and effective mitigation strategies.
